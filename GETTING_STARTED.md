# Getting Started as a Boutiques Developer

This guide will help you set up your local environment for coding and testing Boutiques.

## 0.   Things you'll need

-   **A Linux shell**. It _may_ be possible to develop Boutiques on Windows, but will likely cause many headaches (if you successfully develop for Boutiques on Windows, please update this guide with details!).
-   **Git**. If you don't have Git, instructions to install it are [here](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).
-   **Python**. Boutiques supports any version >= 3.5.
-   **pip**. Most versions of Python will come with it, but in case you don't have it, instructions to install it are [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
-   **Docker or Singularity**. Depending on the tools you plan to work with and where they are installed, you'll want to have either Docker or Singularity installed (ideally both).
  -   To install Docker, follow the  [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) to install Docker CE.
  -   To install Singularity, follow the [instructions](https://singularity.lbl.gov/install-linux) to download the latest stable release of Singularity.
-   **Root (sudo) access**. If your system doesn't already have all of the above installed, you'll need root permission to install new programs.

## 1.   Clone the boutiques repository

-   Fork the [Boutiques repository](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques).
-   Clone your fork locally: 
    -   `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/boutiques.git`
    -   Or, if you installed your SSH keys on GitHub:  `git@github.com:boutiques/boutiques.git`

## 2.   Create a virtual environment

-   Install virtualenv:
  -   `pip install --user virtualenv`
-   Create a virtual envrionment in the base directory:
  -   `mkdir env`
  -   `virtualenv env/boutiques -p python3.6`  (replace python3.6 with the executable for the version of Python you wish to use)
-   Use the environment whenever you work on Boutiques by running:
  -   `source env/boutiques/bin/activate`
-   Note: if you wish to leave the virtual environment, simply run `deactivate`.

## 3.   Install Boutiques, test framework and validation tools

From within your virtual environment in the base directory:
-   Upgrade setuptools: `pip install --upgrade setuptools`
-   Install pytest, pytest-runner and pycodestyle: `pip install pytest pytest-runner pycodestyle`
  -   pytest is a unit testing framework for Python.
  -   pycodestyle checks if your code conforms to Python style conventions.
-   Install jsonlint: `npm install jsonlint -g` 
  -   In case you don't have Node installed, instructions to install it are [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
  -   jsonlint is a tool to validate JSON files. 
-   Install Boutiques: `pip install -e .`
-   Note that pytest, pycodestyle and jsonlint are all used by Travis CI, but it's best practice to test and validate your code locally before pushing it!

## 4.   Build the container images needed for testing

-   Certain test cases involve example descriptors that use a Docker or Singularity container image. These images are not available on DockerHub or SingularityHub and must be built locally.
-   From the base directory, build the example Docker image with the following command:
  -   Note: skip the following step if you do not have Docker installed.
  -   `docker build -t boutiques/example1:test ./boutiques/schema/examples/example1`
-   Once the Docker image is built, convert it to a Singularity image. Again, from within the base directory:
  -   Note: skip the following steps if you do not have Singularity installed.
  -   `docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v ${HOME}:/output --privileged -t --rm singularityware/docker2singularity boutiques/example1:test`
  -   `IMGNAME=$(ls $HOME/boutiques_example1_test*.simg)`
  -   `mv ${IMGNAME} ./boutiques-example1-test.simg`
  -   Your directory should now contain a ~70MB file called `boutiques_example1_test.simg`.
 
## 5.   Try it out!

-   Run `pytest` in the base directory to run all tests
-   Run an individual test file with `pytest boutiques/tests/test_<something>.py`
-   Validate your code style by running:
  -   `pycodestyle --max-line-length=80 boutiques/*.py boutiques/tests/*.py`
-   Validate changes to the Boutiques JSON schema by running:
  -   `jsonlint -q boutiques/schema/descriptor.schema.json`
