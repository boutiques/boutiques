## An example BIDS App (template repository)
Every BIDS App needs to follow a minimal set of command arguments common across
all of the Apps. This allows users and developers to easily use and integrate
BIDS Apps with their environment.

This is a minimalist example of a BIDS App consisting of a Dockerfile and a simple
entry point script (written in this case in Python) accepting the standard BIDS
Apps command line arguments. This repository can be used as a template for new BIDS Apps.

For more information about the specification of BIDS Apps see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1Wi5ONvOVVnGhj21S1bmJJ4kyHFT7tkxnV3C23sjIE/edit#).

### Description
This is a placeholder for a short description explaining to the user what your App will doing.

### Documentation
Provide a link to the documention of your pipeline.

### How to report errors
Provide instructions for users on how to get help and report errors.

### Acknowledgements
Describe how would you would like users to acknowledge use of your App in their papers (citation, a paragraph that can be copy pasted, etc.)

### Usage
This App has the following command line arguments:

		usage: run.py [-h]
		              [--participant_label PARTICIPANT_LABEL [PARTICIPANT_LABEL ...]]
		              bids_dir output_dir {participant,group}

		Example BIDS App entry point script.

		positional arguments:
		  bids_dir              The directory with the input dataset formatted
		                        according to the BIDS standard.
		  output_dir            The directory where the output files should be stored.
		                        If you are running a group level analysis, this folder
		                        should be prepopulated with the results of
		                        the participant level analysis.
		  {participant,group}   Level of the analysis that will be performed. Multiple
		                        participant level analyses can be run independently
		                        (in parallel).

		optional arguments:
		  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
		  --participant_label PARTICIPANT_LABEL [PARTICIPANT_LABEL ...]
		                        The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be
		                        analyzed. The label corresponds to
		                        sub-<participant_label> from the BIDS spec (so it does
		                        not include "sub-"). If this parameter is not provided
		                        all subjects will be analyzed. Multiple participants
		                        can be specified with a space separated list.

To run it in participant level mode (for one participant):

    docker run -i --rm \
		-v /Users/filo/data/ds005:/bids_dataset:ro \
		-v /Users/filo/outputs:/outputs \
		bids/example \
		/bids_dataset /outputs participant --participant_label 01

After doing this for all subjects (potentially in parallel), the group level analysis
can be run:

    docker run -i --rm \
		-v /Users/filo/data/ds005:/bids_dataset:ro \
		-v /Users/filo/outputs:/outputs \
		bids/example \
		/bids_dataset /outputs group

### Special considerations
Describe whether your app has any special requirements. For example:

- Multiple map reduce steps (participant, group, participant2, group2 etc.)
- Unusual memory requirements
- etc.
