    "As you've seen from our documentation, Boutiques is a flexible way to represent command line executables and distribute them across compute ecosystems consistently. A Boutiques identifier is a JSON file that fully describes the input and output parameters and files for a given command line call (or calls, as you can include pipes(`|`) and ampersands (`&`)). There are several ways Boutiques helps you build an identifier for your tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [documentation](http://boutiques.github.io/docs) script helps develop understanding the schema organization\n",
    "- The [validator](https://github.com/boutiques/boutiques/blob/master/tools/validator.rb) enables you to verify your identifier\n",
    "- The [examples](https://github.com/aces/cbrain-plugins-neuro/tree/master/cbrain_task_descriptors) provide useful references for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you aid in this process, we will walk through the process of making an identifier for [FSL's BET](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET) (finished product found [here](https://github.com/aces/cbrain-plugins-neuro/blob/master/cbrain_task_descriptors/fsl_bet.json))."

If your tool was written in Python and you use the `argparse` library, then this is already done for you in large part. For many tools (bash, Python, or otherwise) this can be obtained by typing executing it with the `-h` flag. In the case of FSL's BET, we get the following:"
